30-day     0.756       MEDIUM              ±$789 USD/TEU          Directional guidance only

Risk Assessment Framework
- High Confidence (R² > 0.7): Proceed with procurement decisions
- Medium Confidence (R² 0.5-0.7): Use for operational planning
- Low Confidence (R² < 0.5): Directional guidance only

Key Predictive Features
1. Trade Imbalance Ratio: Primary predictive factor (lagged values)
2. UWFE Price Lags: 1, 7, 14, 30-day historical prices
3. BDI Proxy Price: Baltic Dry Index correlation

Actionable Recommendations
- Book freight 7 days ahead when model confidence is high (>70% R²)
- Use 14-day forecasts for contract negotiation timing
- Monitor trade imbalance ratio - it's the key predictive feature
- Budget for uncertainty bands - ±$1,500-2,200 USD/TEU volatility
